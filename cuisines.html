 <h1>German Cuisine</h1>
  <p>Traditional German Cooking is very steamy, heavy and yummy! Lots of carbs and meat - but don't worry - you can get around that with a few tricks, if that isn't for you. Have a look at our recipes for traditional German Food and their variations and let us know, which one you liked best here. </p><!--insert link to contact page or form to fill in-->

 <h3><u>Spätzle</u></h3>
 	<p>A bit of a messy food to prepare and cook, it makes up for it by having only 4 ingredients and turning out to be one of the best pasta on continental Europe (and maybe the world)!<br/><!--where do I end the paragraph????-->

<h3><u>Grünkohl und Pinkel - Kale with Pinkel Sausage</u></h3>
 	<p>A dish that is not necessarily everyone's fave, but definitely at the top of typical German winter dinners is Grünkohl und Pinkel. You can find a stand selling it at <strong>every</strong>christmas market. And though I wasn't a fan of it as a child, by now I've gotten used to the very special taste and my mum even makes it at home occasionally.<br/>
 	It is easiest to just buy the sausages, but if you wanna give making them yourself a go check this our: https://www.essen-und-trinken.de/rezepte/44069-rzpt-gruenkohl-mit-pinkel<br/><!--where do I end the paragraph????-->
